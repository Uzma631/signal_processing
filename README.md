# PROJECT_1: Blood Pressure Signal Processing in MATLAB
This project simulates blood pressure signals and demonstrates basic signal processing techniques using MATLAB. It includes data generation, noise filtering, and peak detection for systolic and diastolic pressures.

## FEATURES
* Generate synthetic blood pressure data.
* Filter noisy signals using a Butterworth low-pass filter.
* Detect and analyze systolic and diastolic peaks.
* Visualize raw and processed signals.
## RESULTS
* Cleaned signal with marked systolic and diastolic peaks.
* Calculated average systolic and diastolic pressures.
## REQUIRMENTS
* MATLAB with Signal Processing Toolbox.
